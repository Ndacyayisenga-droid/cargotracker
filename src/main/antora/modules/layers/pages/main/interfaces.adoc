== Interfaces

This layer holds everything that interacts with other systems 
(including humans :-), such as REST web services, WebSocket endpoints, 
web UIs, external messaging endpoints, and batch processes. It handles 
interpretation, input validation, and translation of incoming data. It 
also handles serialization of outgoing data, such as HTML, JSON, or XML 
across HTTP to web browsers or web service clients, or DTO classes and 
distributed facade interfaces for remote clients.

The https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/tree/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/interfaces[`org.eclipse.cargotracker.interfaces`] package holds all the 
interface classes for the application. We have two Web UI interfaces - 
one for https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/tree/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/interfaces/booking/[booking] and the other for 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/tree/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/interfaces/tracking/[tracking], as well as one 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/tree/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/interfaces/handling/rest/HandlingReportService.java/[REST interface] 
and one https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/tree/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/interfaces/handling/file/UploadDirectoryScanner.java[scheduled file processor] for reporting handling events. The web 
interfaces are written in HTML/JavaScript/Jakarta Faces, the REST 
interface uses Jakarta REST, while the file processor uses 
`@Scheduled`/Jakarta Batch. Modern web application frameworks naturally 
enforce MVC style separation of concerns, so there is not that much 
heavy lifting you will need to do. In addition, you can enforce a facade 
layer if necessary (e.g., your UI team is sufficiently separated from the 
application services team or you wish to remain strictly agnostic of the 
UI layer). Otherwise, you can use simple adapters to adapt domain classes 
to your UI view. We demonstrate both techniques in the application using 
well-understood existing design patterns such as Facade, DTO, Assembler, 
and Adapter (in addition to MVC of course).

Other than Jakarta Faces, REST, and Enterprise Beans, other Jakarta EE 
technologies typically used in the interface layer are Jakarta EE 
Security, CDI, Bean Validation, JSON Processing/JSON Binding/XML Binding 
(for serialization), Batch, Messaging, and WebSocket.
