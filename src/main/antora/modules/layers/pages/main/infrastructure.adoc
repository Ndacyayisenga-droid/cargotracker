== Infrastructure

In addition to the three vertical layers, there is also the 
infrastructure. As the picture shows, it supports all of the three 
layers in different ways, sometimes facilitating communication between 
the layers. In the most common case, the infrastructure layer consists 
of Repository implementations interacting with a database. In simple 
terms, the infrastructure consists of everything that exists 
independently of our application: external/third-party resources, 
persistence/database engines, messaging back-ends, legacy systems, and 
so on.

All of the infrastructure classes are in the 
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/tree/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cargotracker/infrastructure[`org.eclipse.cargotracker.infrastructure`] package. We use Jakarta 
Persistence, CDI, Messaging, and the REST client API in this layer. The 
application will mostly have Jakarta Persistence code in this layer 
encapsulated with thin CDI bean Repository classes. Other Jakarta EE 
APIs commonly used in this layer include Jakarta Mail and XML Web 
Services clients.
