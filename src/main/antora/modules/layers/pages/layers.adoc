== Layers

The Eclipse Cargo Tracker application is layered as illustrated by 
the following picture.

As you can see, there are three vertical layers: interfaces, 
application, and domain, each supported by different kinds of 
infrastructure. In the application, the https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/wiki/Layers[package naming] reflects 
these layers.
